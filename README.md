Python Capstone: Personal Finance Tracker

# Project Overview

This is a simple **command-line personal finance tracker** built using core Python programming concepts.  
It allows users to:

- Add and categorize expenses
- View all recorded expenses

This capstone project simulates a real-world task and reinforces skills in working with functions, loops, dictionaries, and exception handling.

Variables and data types:
- String operations and input handling
- Control flow (if, else, while)
- Functions and modular design
- Lists, dictionaries, and tuples
- Exception handling with try, except, else, and finally
- Menu-driven command-line interface
